# Sandbox target

A synthetic .NET/xUnit repo, on the `xunit.v3` package at 4.0.0 as the production targets are (ADR-021), that Main Watcher's scenario tests (TS-001) run against.
Everything it does is steered by committing a change to [`sandbox.json`](sandbox.json).

This repo is seeded from `sandbox/sample-target` in the MainWatcher repo by
`sandbox/seed-target.sh`. Change the template there, not here; scenario commits here are
throwaway.

## Running the tests

```
dotnet test
```

It uses Microsoft Testing Platform (`global.json`), so the xUnit retry filter works:
`dotnet test -- --filter-method <name>`. Each test project writes `TestResults/<project>.ctrf.json`
at the repo root, through xUnit 4.x's `--report-xunit-ctrf` option (ADR-007, ADR-021). The exit code is non-zero when a test fails.

Two test projects exist so a run produces two CTRF reports to merge:

| Project | Tests |
|---|---|
| `SampleTarget.Tests` | `OutcomeTests.Alpha`, `.Beta`, `.Gamma`; `BehaviourTests.SlowSuite`, `.Hang`, `.Flaky`; `EnvironmentTests.NoMainWatcherKey` |
| `SampleTarget.Timing.Tests` | `Duration50Milliseconds`, `Duration2Seconds`, `Duration20Seconds` (run in parallel); `Baseline.Runs` |

Tests whose switch is off are skipped, not passed. `Baseline.Runs` always runs, because
Microsoft Testing Platform exits with code 8 when a project runs no tests.

## Switches

| Switch | Default | Effect | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `failing_tests` | `[]` | Names of `OutcomeTests` to fail (`"Alpha"`, `"Beta"`, `"Gamma"`), or `"*"` for all three | Most scenarios |
| `timed_tests` | `true` | Runs the 50 ms, 2 s and 20 s tests | TS-S13 |
| `slow_suite_minutes` | `0` | When above 0, `SlowSuite` waits that many minutes | TS-S2 (slow variant) |
| `hang_test` | `false` | `Hang` sleeps forever and ignores cancellation | TS-S16 (e) |
| `flaky_test` | `false` | `Flaky` fails on the first attempt of a workflow run and passes on the retry | TS-S13 retry flag |
| `inspect_environment` | `false` | `NoMainWatcherKey` searches the test run's environment variables, the runner's work and temp folders and the home folder for a private key, a GitHub token or a persisted git credential, fails naming any it finds (never the value), and writes what it inspected to the job summary | TS-S8 |
| `fail_restore` | `false` | `Directory.Build.props` points restore at an unreachable feed, with an empty packages folder: `dotnet restore` fails with NU1301 | TS-S16, TS-S18 |
| `fail_upload` | `false` | A failing step before the CTRF upload deletes the reports and `timings.json`, so no `main-watcher-ctrf` artifact is uploaded. Read by the sandbox build of the reusable test workflow, not by this repo's tests | TS-S16 |
| `slow_check_minutes` | `0` | On merge groups, the required `sandbox-slow-check` job waits this many minutes before passing, like a target's own slow CI. Read from the merge group's commit | TS-S17, MainWatcher#6 |
| `hang_upload` | `false` | A step before the CTRF upload hangs until its 5-minute timeout. Read by the sandbox build of the reusable test workflow, not by this repo's tests | TS-S16 (d) |
| `hang_upload_forever` | `false` | A step before the CTRF upload hangs with no timeout of its own, so the job runs on after the tests have finished until GitHub's job timeout or Main Watcher's cancel ends it. Read by the sandbox build of the reusable test workflow, not by this repo's tests | TS-S16 (h) |

An unknown key makes every test except `Baseline.Runs` fail, so a typo in `sandbox.json` shows up at once.

`Flaky` remembers its first attempt in a temp file keyed by `GITHUB_RUN_ID` and
`GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT`. Run locally, it fails once per machine, then passes.

## Variants

- `main-watcher-sandbox/sample-target`: the defaults above.
- `main-watcher-sandbox/sample-target-slow`: `slow_suite_minutes: 5`, `timed_tests: false`.

## Merge queue

`main` has the ruleset `main merge queue` (`sandbox/rulesets/main-merge-queue.json`):
merge limit 2, minimum group 1, 1-minute wait, so batched groups can be formed (TS-S5).
Organisation admins bypass it, so scenario scripts can push to `main` directly.

`.github/workflows/main-watcher-gate.yml` is added by `seed-target.sh` from MainWatcher's
`templates/`, using the gate action from the public `main-watcher-sandbox/gate` repo. Its
`main-watcher-gate` job is a required check. While an App-authored `main-broken` issue with a
valid lease is open, merge groups fail unless every PR in them is labelled `fixes-main`.

`sandbox-slow-check.yml` is a second required check. It passes at once on pull requests,
and on merge groups waits `slow_check_minutes`, so a group can sit in the queue with its
gate already passed (TS-S17).

## Self-test

`sandbox-selftest.yml` (manual) restores, runs the tests and checks both CTRF reports.
It is not the Main Watcher test workflow. `main-watcher-tests.yml`, added by `seed-target.sh`
from MainWatcher's `templates/`, is: it calls the reusable test workflow published to
`main-watcher-sandbox/gate`, which runs the tests with a deadline and one retry, and uploads
the `main-watcher-ctrf` artifact.
